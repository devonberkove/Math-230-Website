Let’s take a look as to the statistics that differ between these teams and everyone else in the middle, seeing what statistics lead to a successful season and which ones did not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first statistic that many people think of for a successful season are goals, as teams need to score to win. The scatterplot clearly shows that the best teams not only score the most goals, but also get into good positions to score and have the highest expected goals throughout the season. This is seen with the winners Man City having the highest of both statistics and the rest of the top teams positioned highly on the graph, while the relegated teams were all at or near the bottom for these statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho scores the goals, though? This animation shows a scatterplot of each teams player’s goals scored vs. minutes played by position, and it clearly shows that it is typically forwards who score the most goals, although there are some clubs that have midfielders are their top scorers and one club (Liverpool) who had their goalie score! The top scorers also tended to play a lot of minutes during the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best opportunities to score in a game is if a team is awarded a penalty. This does not happen often, and most goals scored by teams are not penalties, but they can be vital to a game’s result. The better teams tend to get more penalties and hence score more throughout the season as they are usually better at attacking and creating chances throughout games, but that does not mean they are the best at taking them. In fact, there is a wide distribution of conversion rates throughout the league, with a higher league finish not always related to a higher rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother metric that people look at for success is age, and many of the best teams use a wide variety of ages to find the best combination of youthful, exciting players and older, more experiences players to perform well throughout the year. The histogram above also show the distribution of goals for each team, with once again higher goals typically leading to higher finishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly to scoring goals, players must be good at creating chances and getting assists. The best clubs have higher expected assists, which tends to lead to more actual assists and goals throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, what about discipline? It’s best to avoid getting yellow cards and especially red cards to not play at a disadvantage throughout games. However, this plot shows a wide variety of yellow and red cards given to clubs who finished in all places, so while not the best, its okay if teams accumulates cards throughout the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The first piece used the function canvas_nebula with the colors of Bucknell University to make a nebula-like pattern, the second piece used the function canvas_function to create a blue and green spiral, and the third piece used the function canvas_petri with a black backround, white dish, and 25 iterations.\r\nData Visualizations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis data visualization is a treemap that was created using the package treemapify in ggplot2 and the built in dataset mtcars. The treemap consists of two parts, a boxes area and color, where in this case the area refers to a cars horsepower and the color gradient refers to its miles per gallon. A larger area means a larger horsepower while the horse power of a car increases as the color goes from light to dark blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above scatterplot compares the admission rate against the average SAT for a selection of PA Schools by a school’s highest available degree from the CollegeData set in R. In particular, it focuses on Bucknell University in comparison to all the other schools for each metric. Bucknell, like most schools, has its highest degree as a Graduate’s degree, but has a lower acceptance rate and higher average SAT in comparison to most schools. This shows the exclusivity of Bucknell, making it one of the best schools academically in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis a density plot of three different species of flowers, setosa, versicolor, and viriginica based on its sepal and petal length. Each square represent a flower in the data set, and the lighter the shading around the squares, the higher percent of data points that are contained inside it. For the species setosa, most flower typically have petal lengths of around 1 and sepal lengths of around 5, whereas the species versicolor and virginica typically have petal lengths from 4 to 6 and sepal lengths from 5.5 to 7.\r\nConfidence Interval Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a dashboard on the topic of confidence intervals that was meant for intro stat students. In it, the user can switch between one confidence interval and multiple. For the single interval, the mean, confidence level, sample size, and standard deviation can all be changed to understand how changing each metric has an effect on the resulting confidence interval, along with an interpretation of the interval in order to teach the correct interpretations and the intuition behind them. For the multiple interval, users can change the sample size, mean, confidence level, and the number of intervals that are produced. This then creates the number of intervals with the inputs chosen under a normal curve with red intervals not containing the mean and green intervals containing it to show what a confidence level really means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
